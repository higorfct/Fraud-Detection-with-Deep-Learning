## üìù Introduction

The main goal of this project is to **detect suspicious or fraudulent transactions** for a store that operates both in physical and online commerce, in order to reduce financial losses for the institution.  
With this approach, the business can be supported in risk assessment, increasing the effectiveness of fraud detection while avoiding unnecessary blocking of legitimate transactions.

## üöÄ How to use

1. **Clone the repository and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/higorfct/Fraud-Detection-with-Deep-Learning
    cd Fraud-Detection-with-Deep-Learning

## üìä Data

- Dataset: `fraudes.csv`  
- Number of Records: 3,784  
- Number of Attributes: 4  
- Target Attribute: `Class` (0 = Valid Transaction, 1 = Fraudulent Transaction)  
- Predictor Attributes: `amount` (transaction value), `time` (transaction time), and `location` (transaction location)

---

### Steps performed:
- Importing necessary libraries  
- Loading the dataset  
- Checking the number of records and attributes  
- Checking for missing values  
- Preprocessing (feature engineering, normalization, and train-test split)  
- Applying an MLP Neural Network for fraudulent transaction detection

## ü§ñ Predictive Modeling

Algorithm used:
- **MLP Neural Network (MLPClassifier)**

### Why MLP Neural Network?

The MLP Neural Network was chosen due to its ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships between transaction features.  
It is particularly effective for imbalanced datasets, allowing high recall for fraudulent transactions while keeping false positives low.  
With proper preprocessing, normalization, and hyperparameter tuning, the MLP provides robust performance for real-time fraud detection systems.

- A **hyperparameter tuning** (RandomizedSearchCV) was performed to find the optimal combination.  
- The optimized parameters include:  
  - `hidden_layer_sizes`  
  - `activation`  
  - `solver`  
  - `alpha`

# Interpretation of MLP Neural Network Metrics for Fraud Detection

This report presents the performance metrics of the MLP neural network applied to fraud detection in financial transactions.

| Class         | Precision | Recall | F1-score | Support |
|---------------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| 0             | 0.88      | 0.81   | 0.84     | 363     |
| 1             | 0.84      | 0.90   | 0.87     | 394     |
| **Accuracy**  |           |        | **0.85** | 757     |
| **Macro avg** | 0.86      | 0.85   | 0.85     | 757     |
| **Weighted avg** | 0.86   | 0.85   | 0.85     | 757     |

## General Analysis

- The model‚Äôs **overall accuracy** is 85%, meaning it correctly classified 85% of transactions.  
- The **recall for the fraud class (90%)** is high, showing that the model can detect most fraud cases, minimizing false negatives.  
- The **precision for the fraud class (84%)** indicates that most transactions classified as fraud are indeed fraudulent, reducing false positives.  
- For the non-fraud class, the model has 88% precision and 81% recall, meaning a small portion of legitimate transactions may be flagged as fraud (false positives).  
- The model shows a good balance between capturing fraud with sensitivity and avoiding false alarms.  

These metrics indicate that the model is effective for use in fraud prevention systems, ensuring high fraud detection while keeping errors within acceptable levels.

## üí∞ Model Economic Impact

The model generated significant financial impact in fraud detection, as detailed below:

- **Cost of False Positives:** R$ 190,892.43 (‚âà $38,178.49)  
  (Amount lost due to legitimate transactions incorrectly classified as fraud)

- **Savings from True Positives:** R$ 894,317.94 (‚âà $178,863.59)  
  (Amount saved by correctly detecting fraudulent transactions)

- **Net Monetary Impact:** R$ 703,425.52 (‚âà $140,685.10)  
  (Total savings after considering costs generated by false positives)

These figures show that the model contributes to substantial financial savings by reducing fraud-related losses, even when accounting for false alarm costs.
